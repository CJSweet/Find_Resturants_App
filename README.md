# Find Restaurants App

This app opens up to a Google Map Fragment that positions the camera to where the user is located. The map also shows about 80 restaurants in Chicago that have been identified as either a Medium or High risk health concern. The API data can be found here: ![https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/for-csv/j8a4-a59k}](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/for-csv/j8a4-a59k).

I plan to expand on this app by letting users select the restaurant markers to see more information about each one. 

This app was originally meant for an interview, but I have done a little bit of extra work on it since. I plan to do more soon on this app because it uses an API, and it would be good to get more experience working with an API.
